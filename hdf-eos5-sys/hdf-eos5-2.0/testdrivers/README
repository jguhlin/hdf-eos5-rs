==============================================================================

These files are provided as an aid to the user for examples in how to use the
HDF-EOS library.  The test drivers have been run on every platform supported
by the Toolkit.  Platforms supported by the Toolkit are listed in the 
README file located in doc directory.

NOTE:  YOU MUST HAVE ALL OF THE TEXT DATA FILES IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS YOUR 
       POINT TEST DRIVERS.  THEY WILL CRASH WITHOUT THEM !
 
       THESE DATA FILES ARE:

							fixedBuoy0.txt
							fixedBuoy1s.txt
							floatBuoy1.txt
							fixedBuoy1.txt
							floatBuoy0.txt
							simple.txt



DRIVER(S)			    PLATFORM(S)
=========			    ===========

TestSwath.c			    C on all supported platforms
TestGrid.c
TestPoint.c
TestZa.c
TestProfile.c
TestAlias.c

testswath32.f			FORTRAN 77 on all supported platforms
testgrid32.f			FORTRAN 90 on SGI for 32-bit

testza64.f


COMPILING TEST DRIVERS
======================

Below are samples of how the test driver can be compilied and linked to create 
executables.

The HDFSYS flag is set by the user.  The list below gives what it should be
for each supported platform:

PLATFORM		    HDFSYS FLAG
========		    ===========

Dec			        DEC_ALPHA
Sgi			        IRIX
Sgi Power Chall.	SGI64
Ibm			        IBM6000
Sun Solaris 2.5		SUN5
Hp			        HP9000
Linux               LINUX

        -lhe5_hdfeos -lhdf5 -lnsl -lm

NOTE: substitute "filename" with the name of a driver, AND THE ORDER OF THE 
      LIBRARIES IS IMPORTANT. 
      IN ADDITION: NOTICE THAT WE POINT TO BOTH STANDARD HDF AND HDFEOS 
      LIBRARIES. 
      THE "-lnsl" FLAG IS REQUIRED FOR THE SUN PLATFORMS ONLY

NOTE: ON LINUX PLATFORM YOU ALSO NEED "-lz"
  
NOTE: subsitute "filename" with the name of a driver, AND THE ORDER OF THE 
      LIBRARIES IS IMPORTANT.  
      IN ADDITION:  NOTICE THAT THE GCTP LIBRARY IS SECOND IN THE LIBRARY 
      LIST.
      ALSO: YOU NEED TO POINT TO WHERE THE GEOLIB LIBRARY IS LOCATED ON 
      YOUR SYSTEM.
      THE "-lnsl" FLAG IS REQUIRED FOR THE SUN PLATFORMS ONLY
